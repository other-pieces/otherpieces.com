Oh, dating apps.

It’s the new frontier of dating. In the past week alone I’ve downloaded and deleted (and downloaded and deleted again) Hinge, Tinder, Bumble, and Coffee Meets Bagel. Then I re-downloaded Hinge. We’ll see how long it lasts this time around.

I hate the apps. But then I feel like everyone hates the apps. One of the first things I talk about with the guys I end up on dates with is how much the apps (and current dating climate in general) just suck. Naturally, no one seems to know what to do about it.

My friends in relationships (that pre-date the app game) love to tell me that I should just meet someone in person. That it’s the best way to approach the whole finding someone to love thing. To that I say: um, how? I’m not in college anymore. I don’t have that dreamy guy making small talk with me as we wait for class to start. I’m certainly not going to date someone I work with (I’ve made that mistake before). I know, I know. You’re supposed to just see who’s out there in your daily life. Keep your options open. Talk to strangers. Right.

Instead, I swipe. Or I guess, scroll and tap, since Hinge is decidedly anti-swiping (whatever, it’s basically the same thing). And as I swipe and set up my fourth (!) date for the week, I’ll be at home alone thoroughly enjoying another episode of the Great British Baking Show and telling myself that at least I’m _trying_.

And that’s something, right?
