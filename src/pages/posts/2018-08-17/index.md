I’ve been cyberstalking [Elizabeth Suzann](https://elizabethsuzann.com/) for years.

Like all stories of unrequited love, it started out innocently enough. ES pieces started popping up in the feeds of bloggers I followed, and I’d add them to my mental Aspirational Style folder. Then I’d go on with my life and forget about it for a while. And all of a sudden something would pop up on Pinterest and I’d think Wow! Where is that shirt from? It’s so cool! If I had it maybe it would make me cool too! I’d follow the internet link breadcrumbs, and sure enough, it was always Elizabeth Suzann.

Before long, I was following Elizabeth Suzann on Instagram, scouring the internet for reviews of ES pieces, and routinely adding items on their website to my shopping cart. Once, I added one of everything to my cart just because I wanted to know how it would feel, but I was broke, so I didn’t actually buy anything.

Just when the psychosis was really starting to set in, I had a stroke of luck: I stumbled across [this crisp white poplin Linn Tee](https://elizabethsuzann.com/products/linn-tee-cotton-poplin) in a secondhand shop. I scooped it up and never looked back.

I have since bought other ES pieces and have loved them all, but there’s something special about your first love affair, you know?

But really, you should [check it out for yourself](https://elizabethsuzann.com/collections/all-products) because everything they sell is beautiful. And you should [read a bit about their vision](https://elizabethsuzann.com/pages/vision) while you’re at it because they’re up to some pretty amazing things over there.
