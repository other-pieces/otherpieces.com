When my college roommate asked me to be in her wedding earlier this year, my already obsessive online shopping habit kicked into overdrive. I spent hours, days, weeks looking at dresses. It was all I thought about—all I cared about! I looked at thousands of dresses. And yet, I found nothing.

Honestly, the bridesmaid dress market is, in large part, a sad and depressing wasteland of fashion. Don’t believe me? Go type “bridesmaid dress” into Google Images. I’ll wait.

Now, would you like your gathered chiffon of the strapless, one-shoulder, or off-the-shoulder variety? Baby blue? Ballerina pink? Perhaps a nice mauve? Any of the above nine options can be yours for only $400!

This game is not for the faint of heart. At one point I got so desperate I literally searched for “bridesmaid dresses that don’t suck” and you know what I found? A whole lot of articles about how few good bridesmaid dress options are out there, but not a whole lot of dresses.

And then I stumbled across this simple gray dress that made me feel like the prom queen in a 90s rom-com. It cost me all of $50 and—honestly, I’m not just saying this—_I will totally wear it again_.

Of course, this lewk would not be complete without these Diane Von Furstenberg pumps, which are _actual, literal fire_ and you should probably just buy them right now because I’m telling you, you’re going to wear them with everything (bonus: I wore them for eight hours of bridesmaiding and didn’t cry once!).

So here’s to unrelenting online shopping and bridesmaid dresses that make you feel like a total dime piece. May you find yours one day, too.
